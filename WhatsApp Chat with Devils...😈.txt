2/3/16, 4:25 PM - Chandu: Wine taster... humour

At a winery, the regular taster died and the director started looking  for a new one to hire.
   A drunkard with a ragged, dirty look came in to apply for the position.
    
   The director of the winery wondered how to send him away.
   
   He gave him a glass to drink.
    
   The drunk tried it and said: 'It's a Muscat , three years old, grown on a north slope, matured in steel containers.
    
   Low grade, but acceptable.'
    
   "That's correct", said the boss.
    
   Another glass....
    
   This is a Cabernet, eight years old, a south-western slope, oak barrels, matured at 8 degrees.
    
   Requires three more years for finest results'
    
   "Correct."
    
   A third glass...
    
   "It's a Pinot Blanc Champagne , high grade and exclusive,'' the drunk said calmly.
    
   The director was astonished.
    
   He winked at his secretary, secretly suggesting something.
    
   She left the room, and came back in with a glass of urine.
    
   The alcoholic tried it.
    
   "It's a blonde, 26 years old, three months pregnant and if I don't get the job I'll name the father."

Please send a player to check the ground assigned and report back latest by friday noon. Please attach pics (at least 3-4 to cover various parts of the ground) as well.. Once you confirm the ground conditions, Niranjan/Jaimin will send you the ground permit. If the ground is deemed unplayable (CoLa will make that decision based on your feedback AND pics you attach.

Many of the volunteers will be playing the semi finals as well and couple of other free ones might be busy. To avoid any controversy on the game day regarding the ground conditions, please ensure at least one player from each team is sent to check the ground latest by friday noon. If you are unable to, then you will have no say on game day and we will go with what ever feedback we recieved from the other team.

We hope to see teams have a great semi finals game and more importantly, a rain free game. Please play hard and fair. Good luck.

thanks and best reagards

2/6/16, 6:05 PM - Vamsi Devils: Other logistics around managing the volume of teams and the grounds

Son:  mom woh ladki selfi le rhi hai
😂😂😂😜😜
2/10/16, 9:21 AM - Nikhil: Hahaha
2/10/16, 1:26 PM - Ashwin Patti: hi general question
2/10/16, 1:27 PM - Ashwin Patti: is it a must to have keeper in the game? can i remove keeper and instead have him field?
Note: this question is under consideration by cricbay and would be added to the rule book :)
2/10/16, 1:28 PM - Ashwin Patti: but wanted to check what do our folks think?
2/10/16, 1:31 PM - Vijay Tandel: there is no rule in ICC to have a WK, however when there is one, few rules apply which we all know. bottom line playing XI ca have no dedicated WK
2/10/16, 1:39 PM - Santosh kurmana: i dont think there is a rule like that.. :)
2/10/16, 1:41 PM - shashi: This would've been a great tactic during our last game on the last ball..
2/10/16, 1:41 PM - shashi: Even if it went to the back.. They would have gotten only one run
2/10/16, 1:41 PM - shashi: And we would have had an extra fielder in the field
2/10/16, 1:48 PM - Ashwin Patti: Yes
2/10/16, 1:48 PM - Ashwin Patti: Hence the question
2/10/16, 1:48 PM - Ashwin Patti: ☺
2/10/16, 1:50 PM - Ashwin Patti: I think as long as we only have 4 fielders outside the circle and max 5 on leg, we should be okay with no keeper
2/10/16, 5:07 PM - Vamsi Devils: In general,  unless specified,  we can opt not to have a keeper I guess
2/10/16, 5:09 PM - Chandu: Actually we did not lose last weekend
2/10/16, 5:09 PM - Chandu: 😊
2/10/16, 5:09 PM - Chandu: It was a tie
2/10/16, 5:09 PM - Ashwin Patti: Chandu revisited the rule
2/10/16, 5:09 PM - Ashwin Patti: We did lose
2/10/16, 5:09 PM - Ashwin Patti: They say cross
2/10/16, 5:10 PM - Ashwin Patti: Which for me is confusing and subjective
2/10/16, 5:10 PM - Vamsi Devils: Not really Chandu,  if you were referring to the case of batsman completing therun
2/10/16, 5:11 PM - Vamsi Devils: Ashwin mentioned to me and I read thru the rules and no ambiguity found for me
2/10/16, 5:11 PM - Chandu: yes
2/10/16, 5:11 PM - Chandu: I don't think batsman completed the run before batsman hitting the fence
2/10/16, 5:12 PM - Chandu: Shashi might be the best person to say if it did
2/10/16, 5:12 PM - Vamsi Devils: Doesn't need to is what the rule says, as long as the batsmen cross each other when the throw happens
2/10/16, 5:12 PM - Vamsi Devils: Run doesn't need to be completed
2/10/16, 5:12 PM - Chandu: really
2/10/16, 5:12 PM - Chandu: ok my bad
2/10/16, 5:13 PM - Chandu: that makes me feel better 😀
2/10/16, 5:13 PM - Vijay Tandel: in general it doesn't matter if run is completed or not, once it's a over throw its always completed/in progress run + over throw
2/10/16, 5:13 PM - Vamsi Devils: Yup
2/10/16, 5:13 PM - Ashwin Patti: Now for next question
2/10/16, 5:13 PM - Ashwin Patti: What constitutes overthrow?
2/10/16, 5:14 PM - Vamsi Devils: Ashwin, let's talk about our game scenario
2/10/16, 5:14 PM - Ashwin Patti: If a fielder fields the ball on leg side boundary
2/10/16, 5:14 PM - Ashwin Patti: And throws to the fence
2/10/16, 5:14 PM - Ashwin Patti: 1 declared zone
2/10/16, 5:14 PM - Ashwin Patti: Before batsman cross
2/10/16, 5:14 PM - Ashwin Patti: Would that be 1+1
2/10/16, 5:14 PM - Ashwin Patti: ?
2/10/16, 5:14 PM - Ashwin Patti: Or only 1?
2/10/16, 5:14 PM - Vijay Tandel: yes
2/10/16, 5:14 PM - Vijay Tandel: 2
2/10/16, 5:15 PM - Vijay Tandel: in progress run + 1
2/10/16, 5:15 PM - Vamsi Devils: It's clear that they initiated their second run before the throw happened, so our game case is clear
2/10/16, 5:15 PM - Ashwin Patti: Well according to rule
2/10/16, 5:15 PM - Vamsi Devils: No questions on that
2/10/16, 5:15 PM - Ashwin Patti: They need to cross
2/10/16, 5:15 PM - Ashwin Patti: Right
2/10/16, 5:15 PM - Ashwin Patti: As soon they started second had we hit
2/10/16, 5:15 PM - Ashwin Patti: Fence
2/10/16, 5:15 PM - Vijay Tandel: bad rule than :)
2/10/16, 5:15 PM - Ashwin Patti: Is it 1+1 or 1+2?
2/10/16, 5:15 PM - Vamsi Devils: If it was an intentional, then it's a  different case
2/10/16, 5:16 PM - Ashwin Patti: Let's say not intentional
2/10/16, 5:16 PM - Ashwin Patti: Same scenario
2/10/16, 5:16 PM - Ashwin Patti: As our game
2/10/16, 5:16 PM - Ashwin Patti: But batsmen didn't cross
2/10/16, 5:16 PM - Vamsi Devils: Let's not consider that, if unintentionally threw before they cross
2/10/16, 5:16 PM - Vamsi Devils: Yes it is 1 +1
2/10/16, 5:16 PM - Ashwin Patti: Vj there you go
2/10/16, 5:16 PM - Ashwin Patti: ☺
2/10/16, 5:16 PM - Vamsi Devils: Stick to the rule what is says
2/10/16, 5:17 PM - Vamsi Devils: Whether it is right or wrong according to an opinion it is a different story
2/10/16, 5:17 PM - Vamsi Devils: Rule says that, and it makes sense
2/10/16, 5:18 PM - Vamsi Devils: Otherwise if some one starts running out of the blue after the ball hits the fence
2/10/16, 5:18 PM - Vijay Tandel: if the rule that batsmen crossing clause, that's a real bad rule
2/10/16, 5:18 PM - Vamsi Devils: Otherwise there won't be a middle ground up can establish
2/10/16, 5:19 PM - Vijay Tandel: once batsmen start running and overthrow happens it should be completed/current run + overthrow
2/10/16, 5:20 PM - srudeep reddy: Vijay...if the batsmen hasn't crossed when the over throw hit fence which is declared zone then batsmen run shouldn't be counted
2/10/16, 5:20 PM - Chandu: :)
2/10/16, 5:20 PM - Chandu: 👍
2/10/16, 5:20 PM - srudeep reddy: Given that fence is a declared zone ball is dead as soon as it hits the fence
2/10/16, 5:21 PM - Vijay Tandel: with declare zone it's a different story all together and those rules can be tricky
2/10/16, 5:21 PM - Vamsi Devils: Again, it ties back to what I said comparing to ideal scenarios vs our current conditions it makes sense that qay
2/10/16, 5:21 PM - Vamsi Devils: Way*
2/10/16, 5:21 PM - Ashwin Patti: Vamsi a different scenario
2/10/16, 5:21 PM - Ashwin Patti: Trust me this happened in a game
2/10/16, 5:21 PM - Ashwin Patti: Hence asking
2/10/16, 5:22 PM - Ashwin Patti: Fielder fields the ball in the deep (on leg side)
2/10/16, 5:22 PM - Vijay Tandel: bottom line is never throw the ball when it's already a tie 😔
2/10/16, 5:22 PM - Ashwin Patti: Batsman already took one run and started for second
2/10/16, 5:22 PM - Vamsi Devils: 😀
2/10/16, 5:22 PM - Ashwin Patti: Now fielder out of excitement or whatever throws the ball to the other nearby fielder who is running in
2/10/16, 5:23 PM - Ashwin Patti: And that fielder misses or hits him and ball goes out of boundary
2/10/16, 5:23 PM - Ashwin Patti: Is it: 4 or 4+1 or 4+2
2/10/16, 5:23 PM - Ashwin Patti: ??
2/10/16, 5:23 PM - Chandu: ok good to have this discussion :)
2/10/16, 5:23 PM - Ashwin Patti: Unintentional
2/10/16, 5:23 PM - Chandu: time out for now
2/10/16, 5:23 PM - Vijay Tandel: 4 + 2 if they are trying to steal second run
2/10/16, 5:23 PM - Chandu: lets discuss more when we meet for team meeting
2/10/16, 5:23 PM - Ashwin Patti: Both were on leg side nearby
2/10/16, 5:23 PM - Chandu: Guys please take the poll
2/10/16, 5:24 PM - Ashwin Patti: Chandu team meeting lets do stuff other than cricket ☺
2/10/16, 5:24 PM - Chandu: for the party as we have only 9 players has taken the poll so far
2/10/16, 5:24 PM - Chandu: like what 😀
2/10/16, 5:24 PM - Chandu: some guys don't drink, don't gamble, so on and on
2/10/16, 5:24 PM - Vamsi Devils: Per the rule, 4 +1 assuming didn't cross, 4+2 of crosses. But again the subjective thing comes how anyways to argue this
2/10/16, 5:24 PM - srudeep reddy: Chandu...haven't received poll again 😁
2/10/16, 5:25 PM - Ashwin Patti: @vijay: one bad scenario shouldn't negate all others.. We need to always look for win and had ur throw went in we would have won
2/10/16, 5:25 PM - Vamsi Devils: Yes, we need to be like the CricBay, start putting penalties for not taking poll😛
2/10/16, 5:26 PM - Chandu: https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Devils-Cricket-Board/polls/poll/2832630

2/10/16, 5:27 PM - Ashwin Patti: This is in reference to ur statement:

2/11/16, 11:31 AM - Ashwin Patti: and then based on our performance in rd 1 (i mean standing) we would be placed in platinum or gold etc?
2/11/16, 11:32 AM - Sagar Tummula: It matters only for first round ranking
2/11/16, 11:32 AM - Ashwin Patti: as we ended in SF in gold, our rank might be 28
2/11/16, 11:33 AM - Sagar Tummula: No Ashwin. They look into whole last year finishes. 40% for regular, 40% for fall open and 20% for championship league

2/17/16, 3:36 PM - Chandu: 👍
2/17/16, 4:15 PM - Shyam Vempati: A young, well qualified Officer left the job, emigrated to Canada for better prospects and applied for a salesman's job at Vancouver's premier downtown department store. It was the biggest store in the world: you could get anything there.

The boss asked him, "Have you ever been a salesman before?"

"Yes sir, I was a salesman in India. 
The boss liked him and said, "You can start tomorrow. Learn fast and do well."

The first working day was long and arduous for the young man, but he got through it.

Finally 6 pm came around. The boss duly fronted up and asked, "How many sales did you make today?"

"Sir, I made ONE sale!" said the young salesman rather happily.

"Only one sale?!" shot back the boss. "No! No! You see, most of my staff make 20 or 30 sales a day.

If you want to keep this job, you'd better be doing better than just one sale.

By the way, how much was your sale worth?"

"933005 pounds," said the man.

"What?! How did you manage that?" asked the flabbergasted boss.

"Well," said the salesman, "this man came in and I sold him a small fish hook, then a medium hook and finally a really large hook.

Then I sold him a good fishing rod and some fishing gear.

Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the coast.

So I told him he'd be needing a boat, so I took him down to the boat department and sold him that 20-foot schooner with the twin engines.

Then he said his Volkswagen wouldn't be able to carry it, so I took him to our automotive department and sold him that new Deluxe 4X4 Blazer.

I then asked him where he'll be staying and since he had not decided, I took him to camping department and sold him a six-sleeper camper tent.

Then he said I should throw in about $200 worth of groceries and two cases of beer."

The boss took two steps back and asked in astonishment, "You sold all that to a guy who came in for a fish hook?!"

"No, sir," answered the young man, "he came in to buy a headache relief tablet and I convinced him that fishing is the best remedy for headache."

Boss: "Where did you work?!"

"AGENT in the
LIFE INSURANCE CORPORATION OF INDIA, sir."

Boss: "Please take my chair. I want to join your old organisation." 😅
2/17/16, 6:43 PM - Vijay Tandel: We got the message Shyam. Talent young officer is you and the boss is Sheshu 😎

2/18/16, 12:14 AM - Ashwin Patti: Yes, it's always a thriller to defend low scores
2/18/16, 6:39 AM - Ashwin Patti: Sheshagiri Shenoy I remember this match very well .. actually it was not 20 overs match  it was 15 overs due to rain we have started late.Pitch was horrible, when we scored 23 we thought match will be over soon but somehow we managed it to TIE the game :-) Srinivas Singampalli Sumeet Kale

2/18/16, 7:22 AM - Nikhil: Hahah
2/18/16, 8:08 AM - Chandu: I always talk about this game when it comes to commitment and focus of top teams. Never give up ever as anything can happen. Being good team, if we can get bundled up for a low score, we thought why not we do it to our opposition team. We were all pumped up and encouraging each other on the field when opponent needed only 6 runs with 5 wickets remaining. All 11 players were vocal, encouraging and cheering  each other. Most importantly we never lost hope. 

It's easy to say now as it was our day as we were able to defend 23 😊

2/19/16, 6:39 PM - Shyam Vempati: Macula in last match
2/19/16, 9:53 PM - Ashwin Patti: RULE CHANGE: Ruling on ball bouncing over the head

As many of you know the ICC playing conditions result in  a wide being called when a ball bounces above the head of the batsman (in effect out of reach of the batsman). This is probably to combat the potential of bowlers taking undue advantage of the allowance of one bouncer for T20s (two for ODIs). Such deliveries were also counted as part of the allowance.

CoRA and CoRA Advisors reviewed this and decided to simplify this for our games. From the 2016 Regular Season Tournament any ball that bounces above the batsman's head will be ruled as a no-ball (and not a wide) as is the case for anything bouncing above the shoulder.

The primary drivers ?
a) Just makes it much easier for our already over-burdened umpires
b) We do not have any allowances for bouncers, which by extension implies a reduction in the value of differentiating between steeplers that are not reachable and a ball that bounces above the shoulder.

There is an impact to be noted ...
A batsman can be out hit-wicket or stumped on a wide-ball, while these two dismissals are not possible if a ball is deemed a no-ball.

2/23/16, 6:41 PM - Ashwin Patti: Afternoon Games Update (Please inform/update your team mates ASAP)

As discussused during the managers'  meet earleir.. we have gotten to a point where number of morning grounds needed will almost always be more than what is available.. This will be true for most of summer thanks to many other sports leagues competing for the same set of fields.

1. Starting from Weekend of March 5th, At least a few games will be scheduled during the afternoon (130pm-430pm slots). Unfortunately, we are yet to recieve the actual permits and hence can not inform anyone about their "spceific" game being scheduled in the afternoon.. Consider this as a advanced notice for ALL teams. Schedule will be published only after we recieve the permits. 

2. As much as we have tried and as hard as we have worked, It is not possible to guarantee "good grounds" (read 360/matting/etc) for afternoon games at all times.. We will have to be ready to play where ever we are assigned. Please set your expectations accordingly and please let your team mates know. We will try to roatet this "luxuty" of  playing noon games acrtoss all teams over time.

3. If you would like to help by "volunteering" to play in the afternoon, please send an email to CoLa indicating your team would like to play in the afternoon. Please please note: Just because you did not send an email saying you prefer to play in the afternoon, DOES NOT mean your game will not be scheduled in the afternoon.. It will just help us to know about those teams who wouldn;t mind playing in the aftermoon.. and that is all.

4. Most afternoon games will likely be in Fremont area with an exception or two. We will keep adding grounds as we get them.

5. We will continue to look for morning grounds and if/when we get them, we will reschedule some of the afternoon games to the morning slot.

6. We do know that it can get real hot in the afternoons.. but we don;t really have a choice at this time. Please carry coolers, ice, drink a lot of water and stay healthy.

7. One of the things we kept hearing back from many of the schools/cities where we went to get new grounds for mornings: "You guys mess up the ground a lot,  every time you play, there are a bunch of holes, none of your teams ever clean up your mess (baseball/softball teams msotly take care of the groudns pretty well), The money you pay is insignificant to the amount we end up spending to repair the gorunds/tracks".. Some of that sounds harsh but is generally a fair statement. We create a bit of a mess near the batting crease and also near the bowling area.. WE MUST cosciously make an sttempt to spend a few minutes after the game and undo that mess. I Strongly recommend every team carrying a industrial strength Broom, use it to sweep before the game AND use it undo the mess AFTER the game as well.. It is important to do this if we want to be playing Cricket in good fields... It is a matter of time before we lose some of the grounds due to "Cricket destroys the fields" cause.

Best Regards
Sheshu obo Volunteers

2/24/16, 7:59 PM - Vijay Tandel: John decided  to go skiing with his buddy, Keith. So they loaded up John's  minivan and headed north. 


After  driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible  blizzard. So they pulled into a nearby farm and asked the  attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend  the night. 

'I realize it's terrible weather out  there and I have this huge house all to myself, but I'm  recently widowed,' she explained. 'I'm afraid the neighbours  will talk if I let you stay in my house.' 

'Don't  worry,' John said. 'We'll be happy to sleep in the barn. And  if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light.' The  lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and  settled in for the night. 

Come  morning, the weather had cleared, and they got on their way.  They enjoyed a great weekend of skii ng.

But about  nine months later, John got an unexpected letter from an  attorney. It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he  finally determined that it was from the attorney of that  attractive widow he had met on the ski weekend. 

He  dropped in on his friend Keith and asked, 'Keith, do you  remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at  on our ski holiday up north about 9 months ago?'  

'Yes, I do.' Said Keith.

'Did you, er,  happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the  house and pay her a visit?' 

'Well, um, yes!,' Keith  said, a little embarrassed about being found out, 'I have  to admit that I did.' 

'And did you happen to give  her my name instead of telling her your  name?'

Keith's face turned beet red and he  said,
'Yeah, look, I'm sorry, buddy. I'm afraid I did.'  'Why do you ask?' 



'She just died and left me  everything.'


(And  you thought the ending would be different, didn't you?...  I know you smiled... Now keep that smile. 😀😀

2/28/16, 6:05 PM - Chandu: I hope you all had a good time yesterday at our team party. Thank you all whoever were able to attend and also whoever couldn’t make it; I would request everyone to make an effort to attend next time. 

We are delighted and proud of whatever we have achieved last year, our ranks and number of games we won speaks about it. We have improved immensely but we all agreed, still there is room for improvement in all aspects of the cricket game including showing more discipline. Thank you all for your valuable suggestions and questions, we seriously consider all your feedbacks, ponder and will disseminate our thoughts with the entire team. We will do our best that is beneficial to the team. Due to time constraint, you might not had chance to share all your thoughts yesterday, so please let either Vamsi/Sai/me or after the game with the entire team. We are doing our best to be transparent of our decisions but if you have questions regarding our actions do not hesitate to bring it up. We don’t have to wait until team parties like yesterday to raise any concerns you may have.

Congratulations to all players whoever had received Devils awards. We made an attempt to recognize valuable contributions whenever they got an opportunity to perform. 

Lets play hard, do our best and not worry about the results. If we do what we are good at, everything falls in place. Ultimately, do not take the pressure of the game but lets have fun. Lets enjoy the game either we win or lose.

Go DEVILS.
2/28/16, 6:08 PM - Vamsi Devils: Very well put together Chandu and thanks for hosting🙌

2/29/16, 8:41 AM - Chandu: Guys take the poll for this weekend game sent out yesterday for both days. Will confirm the game day once known
2/29/16, 8:55 PM - Chandu: Schedule for rest of the Regular Season 2016 (Week 3 and beyond)

Multiple teams have (rightly) enquired about rest of the schedule so that teams can plan accordingly. With games this weekend, I am sure team leaders will be bombarded with questions as well (since no one knows when/where is their game next weekend or if they have umpiring).. Here's some update and hopefully, you can communicate it to your team mates.

1. We lost a few Southbay grounds to other sports leagues (kid's soccer, new baseball/softball leagues).
2. A few grounds in east bay that were supposed to be ours have not yet been released to us (Thornton for example) and ETA is unknown. This is due to construction, repairs and other issues.
3. We also lost some ground days (grounds we used to get on both days are now available just one of the days)
4. With all the above three being critical challenges, we have been working with cities and schools for last 3-4 weeks.. we have applied for ground permits for mornings, afternoons (basically whenever they are available).. But we are yet to get permits.
5. As a policy, we do not update schedule unless we have permits in our hands though we have a pretty good idea of which grounds we are likely to get.
6. Thanks to Subraya, Plaban and a few others who have been relentless, we will get most of our permits by monday and at the very least, we will know eactly which grounds we will get.
7. We will update schedule for next week by Monday night.. and the rest of  the weeks within a day or two after that.
8. Some teams will be scheduled for afternoon games and if at all we get a morning ground later, we will modify the schedule accordingly.

Please be patient and please note that we have done everything we can.. It is extremely difficult to do any more than what has been done already. Your cooperation as always is greatly appreciated.
2/29/16, 8:55 PM - Chandu: Looks like we need to wait indefinitely to know the game day. But we have a game this weekend
2/29/16, 9:04 PM - Vamsi Devils: Wow, the afternoon games seem very inevitable

3/2/16, 11:45 AM - Vamsi Devils: On Sunday in our Favorite ground - Kitayama Elementary..
3/2/16, 11:46 AM - Sai Devils: Wats with kitayama ground
3/2/16, 11:47 AM - Vamsi Devils: played 2 - won 2... against the Mavs there 😛

3/2/16, 7:16 PM - Chandu: Thanks Sai for sharing the pictures with us
3/2/16, 10:43 PM - Ashwin Patti: Next few weeks of CricBay Games

1. We have severe shortage of grounds but we have worked around it with afternoon grounds.
2. Number of Saturday grounds are way lesser than Sunday grounds.. Number of east bay grounds are lesser too. So, every one who is used to seeing their game scheduled on day they prefer or location they prefer, please be ready to play the day you are assigned, the time you are assigned and location you are assigned.. We will not really look at anyone's preference until we get out of ground shortage (which is most of march/april/may/june)
3. You can always swap grounds with other teams as always.
4. If we do find additional grounds (which we are likely to do), we will adjust the schedule accordingly.

This is a challenge we knew was coming.. you can look at it as a being victim of being such a successful sports league.. Many teams have come forward and supported the changes in schedule, being ready to play in the afternoon.. we are also looking at getting more grounds (read better grounds), in the afternoon,,

Schedule for next few weeks will be uploaded within next 24 hours
Really appreciate your support and cooperation as always

best regards

3/4/16, 10:32 AM - Ashwin Patti: Hello volunteers, I know you are putting in unimaginable number of hours in getting the schedules and ground allocation done on time. It surely is an amazing job and much appreciated.  

That said, I have a questions regarding the 360 ground allocation for teams. We all know the number 360 grounds available is very minimum compared to the cricbay teams and its surely not possible to get good 360 or 250+ grounds every week, but would like to understand how are grounds being allocated to teams. 

Now that schedules are out, We had a chance to look at the allocations and it doesn’t seem like equal opportunity allocation. We find teams with not a single (or at max 1) 360 ground, on the other hand teams having 80% of their matches on 360 Fields. It’s a not a complaint or anything against the volunteers and as I mentioned earlier its surly is an amazing effort to manage and run a 100+ team league day in day out, but when we keep seeing comments that  reads “good grounds can never be guaranteed”, was wondering how it could be different for different teams. 

It’s OK to have this post deleted if you feel it’s in appropriate. :)
3/4/16, 10:32 AM - Ashwin Patti: Damn Sheshu would be mad
3/4/16, 10:32 AM - Ashwin Patti: 😂
3/4/16, 12:54 PM - Ashwin Patti: and here comes reply
3/4/16, 12:54 PM - Ashwin Patti: Why doesn't "MY team" get 360 grounds
Why don't "that poor silver team" never gets a 360 ground
Why does "Team X" get more 360 games than "Team Z" 
How do you decide who gets 360 grounds ?
1. CoLA does NOT look at the away team while assigning 360 degrees. We look at Home team's past record.
2. 360 grounds are NOT always available on both days.. Teams routinely protest if their game day/location preference is not honored.. So, it is likely that if you ask for Sunday and Sunday only (or Saturday) for example, it might look like you did not get to play in a 360 degree for months. As posted earlier, we will not honor preferences for next 3 months (or until that time when ground shortage goes away)
3. South bay teams will rarely get to play in 360 since we have one 360 ground and that is NOT always available. We have tried to move some games to a east bay 360 and that was NOT accepted very well.
4. Teams routinely swap game days/locations and hence what you see now in your team profile doesn't necessarily reflect what was assigned to you in the first place.. and it is also possible that teams swapped and now few teams seem to have been assigned more 360 than others.
5. Teams have literally changed their game locations AFTER they were assigned 360 grounds few times. In other cases (especially during the last few months), Games got rained out and teams were assigned another ground and thus masking the original 360 assignment. Games got rained out and teams were moved to a 360 thus making it look like they got more 360 ground assignments.
6. The combination of 46 games and 2-3 360 grounds (on an average) don't do very well when it comes to distribution.. If one of you Math PhD s can lend in a hand, we will consider it..
7. Some of the teams who "seem" to have gotten more 360 than others have in fact indicated that they would rather play in BB grounds but we only look at who is the home team at this time.
8. "Why can't we randomly assign 360 grounds to teams".. As you know, picking a "random" number between 1-108 might mean, same number gets picked multiple times smile emoticon
9. In next couple of months, we are hoping to add at least 2 360 grounds but we will lose the Milpitas one (or we will not get it as often as we used to since the NCCA/Baca season will start..
Bottom line is, we try to do our best.. we will never ever be perfect (and we know that) no matter how hard we try, some of us will (rightly) have something to complain about while some others will be happy.
Now that we have PM games, I am looking forward to next round of similar questions.. except, 360 will be replaced by PM games smile emoticon
3/4/16, 6:35 PM - Vijay Tandel: Monica Lewinsky released the following statement on Hilary Clinton's run for President:

3/5/16, 1:19 PM - Ashwin Patti: Just sharing our thought process behind booking this ground Sigman Field. 

We reserved it on a experimental basis to see if it works for cricket. Along the same lines as Vishnu Deepak and Shrinivas Kangal alluded to we did not know what we will get. It also costs MORE than regular grass fields. But given the large # of games that are getting lost due to rains and fields getting closed we wanted to try it. And  to avoid getting slammed by teams for allocating a shitty ground for their game - Sheshagiri Shenoy and I chose to be the guinea pigs and have our games there before we assigned it to someone else.

I went and checked the game today - while there is a little bit of spongy bounce the ground seemed fine to me. Most who saw the field thought it was going to be a 200 runs ground. It was not as the result will show. I thought it challenged the batsmen to earn their runs. Good strokes got good value. Bowlers also enjoyed bowling I thought. 

The teams that played - Aryans and East Indies - can elaborate more on their experience.

CoLA will have some special instructions for teams that have games here in terms of marking crease and cleaning up after the game.

3/5/16, 2:07 PM - Ashwin Patti: Ground update for CricBay scheduled games on Sunday (3/6/2016).. Please read the entire post.

1. San Jose grounds - CLOSED tomorrow.. No need to check the grounds .. Please enter the result as abandoned. This includes Norwood Elementary.

2. Sunnyvale grounds - CLOSED tomorrow.

3. Milpitas grounds (Rancho and Anthony Spangler) - CLOSED tomorrow..

4. Fremont grounds (City and Schools) - CLOSED tomorrow with the exception of Sigman field which is open

5. Union City - We have no info on these grounds (they are available only on sundays). Teams can check the ground today (preferred) or tomorrow, provide pics to CoLA and then get clearance to play.  Here are the checks you need to make.

"Fit to play" Test: You CAN NOT play if any of the following holds true
1. A steady rain is falling.
2. Standing water ANYWHERE on the field.
3. Squishy sound made or spongy feel when walking and/or footstep leaves an imprint in the playing area.
4, Mud sticking on the bottom of your shoes and/ or sod is removed easily with a cleat.

Please contact CoLA if you have any questions.
